# dotfiles
dotfiles for my setup

# management

my dotfiles are managed with [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)

# how it works

edit the files as they are located in ```~/.dotfiles```. run ```updot``` in the terminal to apply changes.

# using on another computer

clone the repo to a local ```~/.dotfiles``` folder and copy manually for now (the ```install.sh``` script isn't
configured correctly).

# a note about programs

because I sync these to a linux box with i3 and a mac, I install programs separately.
