This is a cheat-sheet for my emacs config.


* General keybindings
*** Save file
SPC f s
*** Save file as
SPC f S
*** New file
SPC b N for a new buffer
SPC f S to then save it as a new file
If you do this step right away, it'll then launch the mode for the file with all
its nice things
*** Search text
In normal mode, hit / then enter
Use n to navigate forward through results
Use p to navigate backward through results
*** Find and replace
M-% (so Alt+shift+"5" key)
*** Redo
M-_ (so Alt+shift+"-" key)
*** Undo
C-_ (so Ctrl+shift+"-" key)
*** Undo-tree in left pane
C-x u
*** Quit
SPC q q
** File selection
*** See list of files in current directory
SPC SPC
*** Switch to another open file in workspace
SPC b b
*** Switch to another open file in entire program
SPC b B

*** Open directory browser (can edit from there)
SPC o -
** Window management
*** Switch window
C-x o for switching to, say, the other window
SPC w o does the same thing
SPC w <insert vim keybinding for direction>
*** Open new window underneath
SPC w s
*** Open new window beside
SPC w v
*** Delete window
SPC w d
** Workspaces
Workspaces are a /bit/ fucky in that they don't directly correspond to projects,
although this is probably a good thing in the long term - lets you open files.
*** List workspaces
SPC TAB TAB
*** Switch workspace
SPC TAB <workspace number>
*** Switch to next workspace
SPC TAB ]
*** Switch to previous workspace
SPC TAB [
*** Make new workspace
SPC TAB n
*** Name workspace
SPC TAB r
** Projects
Projects are essentially frameworks, the top of a directory, with files.
The general leader key is SPC p
*** Switch project
SPC p p
*** See list of files in project
SPC p .
*** Save all project files
SPC p s
*** Search project
SPC p f
*** Add a new project
SPC p a
*** Delete a project
SPC p d

** Configure emacs
*** Open private configuration files
SPC f P
*** Customize a single variable
M-x customize-variable
*** Search keybindings
M-x general-describe-keybindings
*** Help menu
SPC h
* (ma)Git
*** For now
Just use M-x and search for the thing
* Org keybindings
** Org writing
*** Move to beginning of line
C-a
*** Move to end of line
C-e
*** Insert link
SPC m l
*** Remove link
SPC m L
*** Manually add link
The format of links is
#+begin_example
[[url or filename relative to point][description or link text]]
#+end_example
*** Bold text
Put the text between *two asterisks*. Org automatically does this.
*** Italicize text
Put the text between /two slashes/. Org automatically does this.
*** Underline text
Put the text between _two underscores_. Org automatically does this.
*** Monospace text
Put the text between =two equal signs=. Org automatically does this.
** Org journal
*** Open today's journal entry for creation
SPC j j
*** Open previous day's entry
SPC j p
*** Search journal
SPC j s
*** Save journal entry & exit
SPC j f
** Headings
*** Move to next heading in normal mode
] ]
*** Move to previous heading in normal mode
[ [
*** Toggle heading
z a
*** Close/collapse current heading
z c
*** Remove or add heading status
SPC m h
*** Toggle list or heading status
SPC m i
** Org to-do and agenda
Org to_do is kind of annoying because any combination you write it in, it treats
it as a task to scan (except for underscores)
*** Edit =to-do= status
SPC m t
*** See =to-do= list
SPC m T
*** Add deadline to =to-do= task
SPC m d
*** Open agenda
SPC o A
=OR=
SPC o a a
*** View to_do list
SPC o a t

* Academic stuff
*** Search and enter bibtex entries
M-x ivy-bibtex and then search
*** Are you stuck writing?
M-x academic-phrases.
** PDF mode
*** Add highlight
C-c C-a h
pdf-annot-add-highlight-markup-annotation
*** Add text annotation
C-c C-a t
pdf-annot-add-text-annotation
*** List annotations
C-c C-a l
pdf-annot-list-annotations
*** Copy highlighted text from PDF
y
*** Navigate pages
It's the vim keybindings, luckily
* Snippets
Snippet mode is way more powerful than I thought... many things can be expanded
with just a tab.
*** Add org to_do
Type out =todo= then tab.
*** Load snippet menu
SPC s
*** View all snippets for mode
Be careful: this won't insert, it'll show you keybindings though
SPC s /
*** Add snippet
SPC s i
** Org mode
*** Insert org source block
Hit <s then tab
*** Insert example of code (lets you write out raw org syntax)
Hit <q then tab
You can also, for a single line, just wrap it in =code tags=
*** Insert author property tag
Hit <au then tab
*** Insert title property tag
Hit <ti then tab
*** Insert table
Hit <ta then tab
*** Start new org project
Hit __project.org then tab
*** Start new generic org file with title
Hit __ then tab
